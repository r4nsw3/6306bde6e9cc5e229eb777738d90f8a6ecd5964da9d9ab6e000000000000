  |   "Daedalic Entertainment, once called "Lucasarts from Germany" by      |
  |   the GameStar magazine, invites the players into a fantastic comedy    |
  |   adventure that revolves around a crazy love story of Rufus and        |
  |   Goal.                                                                 |

  |   In Deponia, the world has degenerated into a vast garbage dump, in    |
  |   which the crotchety Rufus ekes out his sorry existence. He is part    |
  |   of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal        |
  |   mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the       |
  |   world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the         |
  |   clouds. Fate seems to smile on the snotty good-for-nothing when one   |
  |   day the attractive lady named Goal from the higher sector plummets    |
  |   into one of the trash heaps. Rufus decides to help the young woman    |
  |   out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's    |
  |   husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical         |
  |   scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't       |
  |   work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty       |
  |   which limits his usual unscrupulousness.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Help Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl      |
  |   from heaven. Only with this rich girl from his dreams he might be     |
  |   able to escape Deponia and, unexpectedly, to save the planet.         |
